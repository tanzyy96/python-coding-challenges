# CGPA Calculator #

### Instructions ###
1) For those who wish to work on the code on their own first, access `CGPAcalculatorTemplate.py`.

2) For those who wish to view my original code, access `CGPAcalculator.py`.

3) For those who simply want to see how my code looks, visit [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/python3/d3078fc168?outputOnly=true&runOption=run&showInstructions=true).

### Extras ###
P.S. When I mention AU for GPA computation, it refers to the number of graded AUs you have completed thus far. This can be found on your degree audit!

If you have any queries or bugs to raise, please leave a comment!<br>
Cheers!
